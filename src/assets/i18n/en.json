    "TITLE": "About Me",
    "CONTENT": "I worked as a front-end engineer at a bank for two years, focusing on building internal form systems using Angular. I collaborated closely with designers and back-end engineers to ensure functionality stability and UI consistency. This experience helped me develop strong communication skills and a steady delivery mindset, with a user-centered approach to development.\n\nCurrently, I‚Äôm deepening my knowledge in modern front-end tools such as RxJS, Signal, and NgRx, while gradually building my portfolio and technical confidence through side projects.\n\nTo me, being a reliable engineer means more than keeping up with new technologies ‚Äî it‚Äôs about delivering with care, growing continuously, and getting things done right.\n\nI'm now open to new front-end engineering opportunities. If you‚Äôre looking for a dedicated, responsible, and growth-oriented teammate, feel free to reach out!"
